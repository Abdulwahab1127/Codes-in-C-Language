/* PROBLEM:
 Sonia sells flower bouquets in a local shop at Mall of Lahore. She wants to keep record of her

bouquets. She has asked you to develop a simple program that inputs prices of different

bouquets sold per day (using while loop, -1 to exit) and provide the following outputs:

i. How many bouquets have been sold?

ii. What was the value of the most expensive bouquet sold?

iii. What was the value of the least expensive bouquets sold?

iv. What is the average value of bouquets?

Expected Output:

Input bouquet price or -1 to exit: 23 45 21 -1

No. of Bouquet Sold: 3

Expensive Bouquet: Rs. 45

Least Expensive Bouquet: Rs. 21

Average: Rs.29.67 */
